- SqlDatabaseOwner _(replaced by a property in [**SqlDatabase**](sqldatabase))_.
- SqlDatabaseRecoveryModel _(replaced by a property in [**SqlDatabase**](sqldatabase))_.
- SqlServerEndpointState _(replaced by a property in [**SqlEndpoint**](sqlendpoint))_.
- SqlServerNetwork _(replaced by [**SqlProtocol**](sqlprotocol) and_
  _[**SqlProtocolTcpIp**](sqlprotocoltcpip))_.

## Getting started

To get started either:

- Install from the PowerShell Gallery using PowerShellGet by running the
  following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServerCustomDsc -Repository PSGallery
```

- Download SqlServerCustomDsc from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServerCustomDsc)
  and then unzip it to one of your PowerShell modules folders (such as
  `$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`).

To confirm installation, run the below command and ensure you see the SqlServerCustomDsc
DSC resources available:

```powershell
Get-DscResource -Module SqlServerCustomDsc
```

## Prerequisites

The minimum Windows Management Framework (PowerShell) version required is 5.0
or higher, which ships with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016,
but can also be installed on Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012,
and Windows Server 2012 R2.

Optionally the PowerShell Module [_SqlServer_](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
can be installed which then will be used instead of the PowerShell module
_SQLPS_ that is installed with SQL Server.
